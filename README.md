I am bithoven and i am doing the odin-recipes project in the odin project foundations course.
I am probably going to make a recipe in html about how to make a pork adobo, it is a filipino cuisine.
i have learned the basics of HTML, tho I need a bit of a cheat sheet because I hate taking notes but I really like to apply it to projects immediately.
